### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems 
for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
I will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by 
computing descriptive statistics. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create 
an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
Files used include:
  • chicago.csv
  • new_york_city.csv
  • washington.csv
